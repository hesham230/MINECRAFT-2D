# Minecraft

## My Structures:

## 1) matrix that contains the world. (2D array [][])
## 2) div that contains the tools.

## The Algorithm
## select a tool:
  1) check if the tool appropriate the tile that you want to remove:
      * if yes: remove it and add it to the inventory;
      * if no: (hover (red color) the tool image) and prevent deletion.
  2) if the inventory not empty:
      * click on the last tile can replace it in the world.
